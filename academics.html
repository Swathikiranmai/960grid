		<h2 class="hidden">Curriculum Policy</h2>
		
		<p>Music lover is committed to "encouraging the growth of intellectual curiosity, creativity and independent learning whilst also preparing each pupil for the best possible examination results, through a broadly based, coherent and balanced curriculum". In this way the curriculum serves the school's mission statement of "the rigorous pursuit of excellence balanced by compassionate concern for individuals".

		<h2 class="hidden">Subjects and Options</h2>
		
		<p>In the early years the emphasis is on acquiring skills in a wide variety of subject areas.  At GCSE and in the Sixth Form the range of subjects available is designed to keep as many options open as possible in order to give each pupil an opportunity to study an appropriately wide variety of subjects in Higher Education. 
		</br>
		The School has a strong commitment to the non-timetabled curriculum, the objectives of which supplement and extend those of the timetabled curriculum. In each year a comprehensive Personal Development programme of Citizenship, life skills and other opportunities is provided including visiting speakers, Industry conferences, residential courses, Field Days, Business Awareness Days, Team Building, Outward Bound, and other activities. A programme of Careers awareness and guidance is tailored to the needs at each Key Stage.</p>

		<h2 class="hidden">Planning and Developments</h2>
		
		<p>In recent years we have reviewed the subjects offered in the Sixth Form to ensure the curriculum fulfils our objectives, resulting in the addition of Physical Education and Drama & Theatre Studies. In September 2011 we also added Psychology and the Extended Project Qualification to the list of subjects offered at AS and A-level.
		</br>
		Each year we monitor alternative and developing schemes of assessment, such as the International Baccalaureate and the Pre-U qualifications, but at present we believe AS and A-levels serve our students best in the Sixth Form, and a mixture of GCSEs and International GCSEs in Key Stage four.
